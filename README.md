### Basic Usage

```python

import numpy as np

# Load your data
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])  # Features
Y = np.array([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]])  # Multi-label targets

# Run feature selection
selected_features, runtime = GranularBall.AttributeReduction(
    X=X,
    Y=Y,
    min_sample=9,                    # Minimum samples per granular ball
    miss_class_threshold=0.5,        # Misclassification threshold
    distance_metric='euclidean',     # Distance metric
    dataset_name='your_dataset'
)
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
preProcessMethod = ['standard']  # Options: 'minMax', 'standard', 'mM_std', 'std_mM'
distance_metric = ['euclidean']  # Options: 'chebyshev', 'euclidean', 'manhattan'

# Configure misclassification thresholds
miss_class_threshold = [0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, 0.95]

# Configure granular ball sizes based on dataset size
